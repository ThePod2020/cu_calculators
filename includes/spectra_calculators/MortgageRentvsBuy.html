<div id='KJECalculatorDescID'>Should you rent or should you buy your home? It takes more than looking at your mortgage payment to answer this question. The Home Rent vs. Buy calculator helps you weed through the fees, taxes and monthly payments to help you make a decision between these two options. This report is based on the original purchase price, fees and taxes payable at that time.  Insurance and tax costs can fluctuate from year to year.  Click the &quot;View Report&quot; button for a detailed look at the results.</div>
