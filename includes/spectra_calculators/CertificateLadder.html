<a id='KJEMainContent' title='page content'></a>

<div id='KJECalculatorDescID'>Use this calculator to examine the benefits of investing in a series of Certificates with different maturities, also called a 'Certificate Ladder'. With a Certificate Ladder, you can benefit from higher interest rates for longer maturities, while achieving better liquidity, rather than investing in a single long-term certificate. <!--showstart<p class=KJEIntro>To maximize results of the Certificate Ladder, each maturing certificate should be reinvested in a new certificate with a term equal to the longest term certificate. This strategy allows you to take advantage of the higher rates normally associated with longer-term certificates while maintaining frequent access to your funds.<p class=KJEIntro>For example: If you established a ladder with 6-month, 12-month, 18-month and 24-month terms, when the 6-month certificate matures, invest the funds in a new 24-month certificate. Similarly, when the 12-month certificate matures, invest the funds in another new 24-month certificate, and so on. At the end of two years you'll have four, 24-month certificates with a certificate maturing every six months. showend--></div>
